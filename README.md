#JSON M Edit
A minimalistic JSON Editor.

#Building & Include
Copy the repo into a public accessible directory (marked as `{$PATH}` in the
code below).

##Include to a web page
JSONMEdit is build with the [Closure Compiler](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/) to cretate a single code file which can be included. Go to [resources/closureCompiler](resources/closureCompiler) and run the [closureCompiler.sh](resources/closureCompiler/closureCompiler.sh) to generate a minified version of JSONMEdit. The minified file is then placed under [libs/JSONMedit.js](libs/JSONMedit.js) and can be included as follows:
```html
<!-- if you already include query you can skip this include -->
<script src="{$PATH}/libs/jQuery_v1.11.1.js"></script>

<!-- include JSONMEdit -->
<script src="{$PATH}/libs/JSONMedit.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="{$PATH}/resources/css/jsonEditor.css">
```

##Debugging & Developement
For debugging or developing include the uncompressed code into your html:
```html
<!-- if you already include query you can skip this include -->
<script src="{$PATH}/libs/jQuery_v1.11.1.js"></script>

<!-- include interfaces -->
<script src="{$PATH}/src/interfaces/Interface.js"></script>
<script src="{$PATH}/src/interfaces/IEventHandler.js"></script>
<script src="{$PATH}/src/interfaces/IEditor.js"></script>
<script src="{$PATH}/src/interfaces/IEditorProvider.js"></script>

<!-- include code -->
<script src="{$PATH}/src/EventHandler.js"></script>
<script src="{$PATH}/src/JSONNullEditor.js"></script>
<script src="{$PATH}/src/JSONNumberEditor.js"></script>
<script src="{$PATH}/src/JSONBooleanEditor.js"></script>
<script src="{$PATH}/src/JSONObjectEditor.js"></script>
<script src="{$PATH}/src/JSONArrayEditor.js"></script>
<script src="{$PATH}/src/SimpleStringEditor.js"></script>
<script src="{$PATH}/src/jsonEditor.js"></script>
<script src="{$PATH}/src/DefaultJSONEditorProvider.js"></script>

<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="{$PATH}/resources/css/jsonEditor.css">
```
###Generating documentation
Documentation is generated with [JSDoc](https://github.com/jsdoc3/jsdoc. Change to [docu/](docu/) and run [docu/jsDocGen.sh](docu/jsDocGen.sh) to create a new documentation of the code. (The used jsdoc template does not include any timestamps or version numbers. Therefore the documetation should stay the same if the the code does not change and only a changed documentation in code is added to git commits)

#Usage
Every Editor included, implements the IEditor interface and therefore can be
used on its own to edit their specific JSON type.

##Dynamic JSON Editor

The ``JSONDynamicNode``-Editor dynamically chooses the right Editor for the JSON
value given. Be carefull when passing arbitrary objects (especially if not
parsed from JSON strings) and make sure to only pass objects with non circular
references. No check for circlular references is done and therefore the
application will loop infinitely if such an object is passed as a parameter.

##Editor Providers

For simple selection by json names the ``DefaultJSONEditorProvider`` can be used.
A self implemented version of the ``IEditorProvider`` also provides a way of
controlling sub editors if you wish to replace e.g. the boolean editor, of a
``JSONDynamicNode``-Editor.

```js
var provider=new DefaultJSONEditorProvider();

/* create a dynamic json editor. See the documentation for other accepted
 * constants ("string", "number", "array", etc.)
 */
var editor=provider.requestEditor("json");

//set value
//editor.setValue([1,2,3,4]);

//attach editor to your gui
//editor.getDom().attachTo(some jquery node);

...

//if the editor is not needed anymore
provider.disposeEditor(editor);
```

##JSON Strings

For JSON strings the ``JSONEditor`` can be used. It parses the JSON string
and displays it in a ``JSONDynamicNode`` (for non valid JSON string a fallback
to text mode is done).

```js
var provider=new DefaultJSONEditorProvider();

//create a json editor which can handle json strings
editor=new JSONEditor(undefined,provider);

//set value
//editor.setValue("{\"helloWorld\":[1,2,3,4]}");

//attach editor to your gui
//editor.getDom().attachTo(some jquery node);

...

//if the editor is not needed anymore
provider.disposeEditor(editor);
```
